# ChronoTrade

## Description

ChronoTrade is a Python-based project designed to provide a robust and flexible framework for time-series data analysis, particularly focusing on financial trading applications. It offers tools for data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, backtesting, and strategy evaluation. The core value proposition of ChronoTrade is to simplify the process of developing and testing trading strategies by providing a modular and well-documented codebase. This allows users to focus on the logic of their strategies rather than the complexities of data handling and infrastructure.

## Features

*   **Data Acquisition:** ChronoTrade provides interfaces to easily fetch historical data from various sources, including common financial APIs and local data files (CSV, Parquet). It supports automatic handling of timezones and data alignment.
*   **Feature Engineering:** A comprehensive suite of technical indicators and feature generation tools are included, allowing users to create custom features based on historical data. Built-in functions for calculating moving averages, RSI, MACD, and volatility metrics are provided.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** A vectorized backtesting engine allows for rapid evaluation of trading strategies on historical data. Supports various order types (market, limit, stop-loss), position sizing methods, and commission models.
*   **Strategy Optimization:** Tools for optimizing strategy parameters using techniques like grid search and walk-forward optimization. Helps identify the best parameter sets for a given strategy and market condition.
*   **Performance Reporting:** Generates detailed performance reports including metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, and profit factor. Visualizations are provided to assess strategy performance and risk.

## Installation

To install ChronoTrade and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    `git clone [repository URL]`
    `cd ChronoTrade`

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    `python3 -m venv venv`
    `source venv/bin/activate`  (Linux/macOS)
    `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    *Note:* Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.  The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of all necessary dependencies, including libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and potentially others depending on the data sources you intend to use. If you plan to use a specific data provider's API, you might need to install additional packages specific to that API. For example, if using Alpaca's API, you would install `alpaca-trade-api`.
